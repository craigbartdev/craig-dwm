My personal configuration of dwm.
Instructions for Arch-based linux distros

These are just my preferred programs, patches, and configurations. Add or remove whatever you want on your own machine.

Installation (view required suckless and arch packages further down to get full features)
in /usr/local directory:
git clone https://github.com/craigbartdev/craig-dwm
cd craig-dwm
sudo make clean install

After copying .xinitrc and installing xorg (instructions further down):
startx

All keybindings listed after line 90 of config.def.h

Change DWM Config (if you want to)
Backup the config:
cp config.def.h config.def.h.bak

Make changes in config.def.h in text editor:
vim config.def.h

copy to config.h:
cp config.def.h config.h

build:
sudo make install


REQUIREMENTS

My .bashrc and .xinitrc packages. These will give you my bash aliases, status bar, and more:
cd /usr/local/craig-dwm
cp mybashrc ~/.bashrc
cp myxinitrc ~/.xinitrc


Required/helpful suckless packages installation:
cd /usr/local
git clone git://git.suckless.org/dmenu
cd dmenu
sudo make clean install
cd /usr/local
git clone git://git.suckless.org/st  (or clone my version: git clone https://github.com/craigbartdev/craig-st)
cd st
sudo make clean install
cd /usr/local
git clone git://git.suckless.org/scroll
cd scroll
sudo make clean install


Required pacman and AUR packages (these are used in config.h, .xinitrc, and .bashrc):

Install xorg:
pacman -S xorg xorg-backlight

Install yay (or can install paru from AUR):
pacman -S yay

Install vim:
pamcan -S vim

Install the following font packages (commands for arch based distros):
pacman -S ttf-linux-libertine ttf-dejavu noto-fonts-cjk

Install the following file managers (command line and gui):
pacman -S lf pcmanfm-gtk3

Install the following audio packages:
pacman -S pulseaudio pulseaudio-alsa pulseaudio-jack pulseaudio-bluetooth

Install the following bluetooth packages:
pacman -S bluez bluez-utils blueman

Install the following image viewers (feh for wallpapers, sxiv for images and gifs):
pacman -S sxiv feh

Install Firefox:
pacman -S firefox

Install Arandr (configure multimonitor setups easily):
pacman -S arandr

Install VSCodium (libre version of VS Code):
yay -S vscodium-bin vscodium-bin-features vscodium-bin-marketplace

Install Reaper DAW:
yay -S reaper-bin

Install JACK audio and tools:
yay -S jack2 pulseaudio-jack qjackctl a2jmidid

Install MOC music player:
yay -S moc-pulse

Install pfetch:
pacman -S pfetch

Install pomotroid (pomodoro timer)
yay -S pomotroid

Now bash aliases, keybindings, and status bar should work. 
Look online for how to properly configure reaper-bin, qjackctl, feh, and moc-pulse, or switch them out for your preferred programs.



Original dwm README from suckless:
dwm - dynamic window manager
============================
dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.


Requirements
------------
In order to build dwm you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running dwm
-----------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start dwm using startx:

    exec dwm

In order to connect dwm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec dwm

(This will start dwm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

In order to display status info in the bar, you can do something
like this in your .xinitrc:

    while xsetroot -name "`date` `uptime | sed 's/.*,//'`"
    do
    	sleep 1
    done &
    exec dwm


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of dwm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
